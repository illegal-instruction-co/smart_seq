# smart_seq - A Smart Sequence Container

This code is a special data structure written in C++. It's designed to be faster than a standard array or vector.

Why I Created This

My main goal was to solve a common problem in high-performance C++ projects. You often have two choices: use a simple but slower std::vector, or create a complex, hand-optimized data structure for performance. I wanted something in the middleâ€”a container that was both easy to use and fast.

This code aims to fill that gap.

### What It Does

    Super Fast for Small Data: If you only add a few elements, the code avoids using extra memory on the heap, making it much faster.

    Smart for Large Data: If you add many elements, it automatically organizes your data to be cache-friendly. This helps your CPU access data more efficiently, which speeds up your program.

    Automatic: You don't need to write complex code. Just add your data, and it handles the rest.

### A Note for the Future

While this approach can be very useful, it might not always be the absolute best solution. To truly see its value, more detailed benchmarks are needed. It's important to remember that the most extreme performance often comes from manual, fine-tuned optimizations. This code simply provides a strong starting point for that journey.
